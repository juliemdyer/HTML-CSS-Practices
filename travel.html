            <h2>I love traveling!</h2>
            <p>I was very fortunate to be intorduced to traveling at a young age - I had my first passport when I was 6 months old! From there I have had many traveling adventures including living on a boat for 2 years with my family in the Carribean when I was in 4th and 5th grade.</p>
            <p>As an adult I've also been able to travel to lots of exotic places, my favorite being Thailand. There are still a lot of places I'd like to visit, hopefully soon!</p>
