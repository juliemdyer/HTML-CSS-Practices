            <h2>Yoga is one of my favorite hobbies!</h2>
            <p>I first started practicing yoga about 3 years ago. I had never been interested in any kind of exercise but as I was getting older I thought it was important to find some kind of physical activity that I would enjoy doing.</p>
            <p>Yoga ended up being fantastic for that because it's great for the body and the mind.</p>
