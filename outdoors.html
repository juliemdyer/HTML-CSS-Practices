            <h2>Being outside is the best!</h2>
            <p>Any time the weather is nce you can find me outside. Some of my favorite outdoor activities are riding my bike and hiking. I also enjoy reading, and reading a good book outside is wonderful.</p>
            <p>In the winter months I love to ski. I haven't made it to the slopes in a few years but I'd love to go back as soon as I get the chance. </p>
